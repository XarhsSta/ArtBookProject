# ArtBookProject
ArtBookProject is an Android app which I created during the time I was learning DI using Hilt, and also learning Unit Testing.<br /> 
It allows the user to search for Pictures online, and save them while adding the name of the Picture, the name of its Artist and the Year when it was created.
